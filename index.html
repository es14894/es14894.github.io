    <p>Hello all! My name is Emil Salonga. I was born in Los Angeles and currently go to school at NOVA in Skopje, Macedonia. I am a 15 year old student.</p>
    <p>My favorite subject in school right now is Computer Science because my dad works in IT and I actually learn a lot in that class. My main hobbies are reading and playing video games. I also have a little experience in graphic design and video editing. For example, I made the simple logo in the top left corner.</p>
