        <h2>Middle School - 2016-19</h2> 
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>I haven't done a lot of projects at my schools, so I've compiled a list of things I've done and places I've been to: <br>I started middle school in Virginia, in the United States. I spent 7th and 8th grade in Guangzhou, China, at the American International School of Guangzhou. The closest thing to a project I've done was here, where every year, we went on "China Trips", where'd we go to a part in inland China and do some activities and meet some of the locals.</p>

              <p>Since coming to NOVA, I've been able to do a lot of extracurricular activities. For example, I'm a member of the Student Council, which works fundraisers and makes a difference in the school. I've also practiced the basketball team, not missing a practice (although I didn't make the team and all the friendlies got canceled because of coronavirus. I also practiced with the Knowledge Bowl team, which I'll hopefully be a part of next year. Finally, I'm also in the Math Counts team, which helps me train my brain during the quarantine.</p>
